# Essentials

In order to publish your game on our platform, we need some basic information about your product that will be displayed in the storefront.

!!! Info "Pre-release"
    When it comes to preparing a *Coming Soon* or a *Pre-order* page, the game build(s) can be provided at a later date.

## Assets Checklist

- **Game DRM-free master build**
- **Game key art & logo** in at least 1920 x 1080 layered PSD files. [In our assets pack](https://items.gog.com/templates/gog_art_assets.zip) you will find the templates that you can use to create the storefront assets yourself. The instruction is embedded inside PSD templates.
- **Game description** (with localized versions) & **system requirements**
- **Screenshots** (12 is the preferred number; all should have the same aspect ratio)
- **Trailer** (including the GOG logo on the endslate, or store agnostic). You can download the GOG.com logo pack from [our repository](https://items.gog.com/GOG_logo.zip).

!!! Tip "Existing Game Info on Other Platforms"
    In the case of a game description and system requirements, you can provide us with links to your game page on other platforms. The same applies to screenshots and a trailer — as long as they are store neutral (have no store logo such as Steam).

## Other Information

- **SKU breakdown** if you plan to release special/deluxe edition, DLCs, soundtracks, bundles etc.
- **Price list** and **launch discount.** You can find the template [here](https://items.gog.com/price_list/gog_price_list.xlsx)
- Your **approval to generate 30 royalty-free review codes**. The codes will be distributed by our PR team among media and influencers interested in covering your game in their channels
- **E-mail address** of a person who takes care of **community relations** in your team – we’ll add his/her account to the developers group on our forums.

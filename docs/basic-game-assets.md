## Preparing the Build

☐   Please deliver [(Build Delivery)](build-delivery.md) DRM-free Release Candidate for all supported OSs (Windows, MacOS, Linux) and (optional) with our [Galaxy SDK](sdk.md) implemented (for achievements, Leaderboards, Galaxy Multiplayer etc.). For best and fastest results please consult [Quality Assurance](quality-assurance.md) article  

☐   If achievements are to be implemented: Please provide a short guide on how to unlock the easiest/fastest achievements in game and if it's not possible within the first 15-20 minutes of playing, a save file from the moment in game just before unlocking a certain achievement  
 
☐   If Cloud Saves are to be added: Please provide actual cloud saves path (cloud saves will be added if quota doesn’t exceed 200 MB and saves are stored in separate subfolder - no support for loose files or registry entries)  

!!! Tip "Important"
    Please do not unpublish (or delete) any previous builds in DevPortal - it helps us keep track of the changes and may prove useful in case we need to use our rollback feature.

# User Management

If you are a User Admin, you can invite other users to the developer account displayed in parentheses next to your username.

![Invite User](_assets/devportal-user-invite.png)

If this developer account has more than one game assigned to it, you can invite users while granting them access only to specific games:

![User Access](_assets/user-access.png)

By default, User Admins will have access to all roles on all games. They also have the ability to manage users and invite new ones.

*Users→Manage* will let you grant the status of a User Admin to already invited users, changing their role for all games assigned to the developer account:

![Users Manage](_assets/users-manage.png) 


You can manage permissions per game in the *Games* view:

![Game User Permissions](_assets/game-user-permissions.png)

Here you can manage the pipeline and licenses access of already invited users and change them individually for each game on the developer account:

![Game User Permissions Panel](_assets/game-user-permissions-panel.png) 

All users that previously had pipeline access (access to GOG tools for releasing a game), will now have pipeline access to all games on the developer account.

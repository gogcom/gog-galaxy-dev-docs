# Common Questions

1. **Can I collect feedback about my game through your forums or redirect GOG users to my website?**

    Certainly! Please feel free to create a thread in your game sub-forum specifically for bugs, suggestions, or feedback. Should you require any assistance with this, please don’t hesitate to contact your Product Manager.

    We have no reservations with you asking users to visit your website or forums for feedback, but we kindly ask that you refrain from encouraging users to visit communities or forums on other distribution platforms to provide feedback or suggestions.

2. **Is it possible for me to publish my updates?**

    You can use our developer pipeline tools and developer portal to upload and manage builds for your game. You can find more information on these topics in [*Build Delivery*](build-delivery.md).

3. **Do you support experimental or beta branches that I can use for limited distribution of a patch?**

    We certainly do! You can read more about beta branches in [*Build Branches*](build-branches.md).

4. **What happens when my game is ready for a full release?**

    When your game leaves our Games In Development program, it is treated as a new release, with full promotion and featuring of the game on our homepage. The InDev labels and banners are removed by your assigned Product Manager at GOG and any reviews for the game are updated to highlight that they were made when the game was in development. The InDev FAQ is unstickied in the forums, but we leave the thread intact, so that users can read the development history of the game. Should you have any marketing or promotional plans for the full release of your game, please contact our [Marketing team](basic-game-assets.md#contact-us).

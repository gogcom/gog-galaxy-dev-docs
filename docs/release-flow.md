# Game Release Flow

There are four major steps necessary to release your game and two more to make your released game a successful one:

1. Get prepped using our [Essentials Checklist](basic-game-assets.md)
2. Implement the [GOG GALAXY SDK](sdk.md) by learning on our [C# Demo Game](demo-desc-and-prerequisities.md). You can also learn more about [Porting Your Games from Steam](gog-and-steam.md) to GOG and about our [SDK Wrapper](steam-sdk-wrapper.md)
3. Make a game build using [Build Creator](bc-quick-start.md) or [Pipeline Builder](pb-quick-start.md)
4. Deliver [(Build Delivery)](build-delivery.md) and test the build [(Quality Assurance)](quality-assurance.md). Please keep in mind that [Linux Games](linux-guidelines.md) require a different approach. We also offer bonus backup installers, called [Offline Installers](offline-installers.md)
5. Maintain your game after the release and remember to monitor GOG users needs. Our [Post-Release Handout](https://devportal.gog.com/support/post-release-notes) might help with that. For more information please visit [Updates](updates.md) & [DLC, Extras & Demos](dlc-and-extras.md) articles
6. Remember to feature GOG links on your websites and in social media. Our [GOG Store Widget](gog-widget.md) might be of use
